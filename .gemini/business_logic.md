project warehouse.
i am developer of this app.
i am going to make this app service like app. which means warehouse owner gonna buy the account for this app from directly from myself and i am gonna manually add new users to databes(in future we gonna add admin panel for this).
each warehouse owner gets one account for their company and 1 user will use it (i dont care if manager or owner himself uses it).
each company can see only their inventory list and category list. and only they can edit it.
point of the project is owner/manager can see their inventory using this web app and edit it real time.
